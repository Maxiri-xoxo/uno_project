                    I can’t say it any other way than you’re the best,
                    I could go all day talking about how you’re different from the rest,
                    Sometimes I wonder if this is all a dream, maybe a test,
                    But even in the dream, you’d still be Sophia, my first.

                    2 months, that’s how long it’s been
                    Since I started talking to you, making me feel seen
                    My only mission is to make you mine that’s why I’ve been keen
                    To keep our love, so we could tell our story starting with ‘since we were teens’.

                    9 weeks, a lot has really happened
                    We’ve fought, we’ve made up
                    We’ve grown, we nearly gave up,
                    But I’m glad we didn’t, 
                    Because you’ve become my fave
                    The girl that fills my rave
                    A future with you, that’s what I plan to pave
                    If we were both falling, it’s you I’d still save,
                    Because I would want to prep the heavens for your beauty, your wave.

                    For every week, I’ll give you a reason why I love you.
                    - I love you because you you’re considerate.
                    - I love you because you like to resolve conflicts instead of avoiding them.
                    - I love you because you care about me.
                    - I love you because you’re stupendously gorgeous.
                    - I love you because you’re smart and intelligent.
                    - I love you because you’re unique.
                    - I love you because you give a sense of warmth and comfort I can’t find anywhere else
                    - I love you because you have a big bum.
                    - And lastly, I love you just because.

                    Sophia, words can’t express the love and affection I feel for you, 
                    it seems like we’ve only just met but also like I’ve know you for ages. 
                    I believe that time cannot replace what the heart cannot displace, 
                    I don’t think anything can make me feel the way you make me feel, ecstatic, enthusiastic… happy, 
                    you’re indeed amazing. We’ve had our ups and downs but you’ve always came through, 
                    you’re my shinning star, my princess. I love you.
                    You’re strong, you’re amazing, I’d rather have no one by my side, the weight you carry… 
                    it’s unimaginable, and I just hope I can show you that I do want to take some of that weight off you, 
                    because you deserve the best… I know we’re not married and this is typically associated with marriage, 
                    but for better for worse, I’m not going anywhere, whenever you’re ready, I’m here, and even if you won’t be, 
                    that’s fine, I’ll be by your side, watching, staying, stroking your hair, until the smile I fell in love with comes back, 
                    because Sophie, you’re the one❤️.

                    You’ve been amazing, always there, always trying, even though we have little arguments, 
                    we never truly fight, and I love that. I love how we love each other, 
                    no relationship is perfect but ours is definitely up there. I’m glad you’re in my life, 
                    even though I uncontrollably miss you every second you’re not with me, it still lights up my heart when I see you, 
                    I don’t plan on running away when things get hard or more serious, I’m here to stay because I believe in us, 
                    because I believe in you, because, Sophie, believe me, this isn’t enough to describe how much but I love you. 
                    I love you Sophia. I’m hoping you see the future I see for us as well and I don’t mind waiting for however long until it’s realised, 
                    because you’re the one I actually want to spend the rest of my life with. We have somethings to work on and we will, 
                    but for now, if there’s anything on your mind, anything at all, talk to me, I’m open, I’m here, let me be your shoulder to cry on, 
                    I’ll always listen, you have me, and don’t forget that. I love you honey bun❤️.

                    Sophia, let me start off by saying thank you, thank you for being there, thank you for being you, 
                    thank you for every little thing, I appreciate it all. We’ve been through quite a lot, 
                    both good and bad, and I’m grateful for all of it because it has led us to this moment, 
                    where I could stand by you and say that I trust and love you. 
                    Every day is a new beginning but a new year has more significance, I love us, so it not new year, 
                    new us, it’s new year, better us. Although you are perfect in my eyes, 
                    we could always build each other more and we will because I am commited to you, 
                    I see a future with you and I want to work towards it. 
                    May this new year bring us more joy, success and good memories, for together, we shall prosper. 
                    Happy new year Mamaa, I love you❤️.

                    Sophia, my first, my honey bun, Happy 1 month anniversary, 
                    words couldn’t say how much I love and appreciate you, but I’ll try.

                    My baby, the one I want to take care
                    The feelings I have for you, only a fraction which you are aware
                    But it’s only fair
                    That I tell you where… and how
                    How wonderful I feel when you are near
                    When your fingers rub on my hair
                    Hot and fiery but I only see the flare.

                    Sophie, we’ve been through a lot
                    From smile to from and from joy to hurt
                    But
                    It still doesn’t overcome the feeling I once thought
                    I’d never have again, what a lucky cut
                    Still trying to connect all the dots
                    Of how someone as beautiful as you are is the one I got
                    If I say you’re my world no one would dare to ask me what.

                    For the third and final verse
                    I’d like to say this
                    It isn’t thought about or rehearsed 
                    But straight from the heart
                    If every time I thought about you would be a drop of water
                    I could swim in that ocean forever
                    Your smile gives a new definition to beauty
                    For you are the cutest cutie
                    You make my heart race
                    Faster than it’s normal pace
                    Not that I’m complaining
                    But if you committed a crime I’d be all over your case
                    Your face
                    The beauty that haunts me
                    I’d go down to tie your lace 
                    For how could someone like you fall
                    And not for love
                    Cliché but your eyes actually twinkle 
                    For the stars don’t even come close in the galactic race
                    There wouldn’t be any competition
                    To have you forever, that’s my mission
                    Not to love you forever, that’s my only opposition.

                    This was for our first month anniversary.
